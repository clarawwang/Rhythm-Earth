Project Name: Rhythm Earth

Purpose: The main goal of this project is to teach people the basics of recycling, composting, and trash. The project is structured as a rhythm game, like Guitar Hero, where players where blue gloves and sort the waste properly on the beat.There are two modes, Game Mode and Learn Mode. Game Mode is structured such that players use their left hand to catch waste on the beat which is denoted using a line on the screen. For long beats, the left hand should be clenched and swiped through the notes. For single beats the left hand must unclench before clenching back onto the beat. The right hand should be on the correct method of waste disposal for each beat. Score increases as the player hits beat and health increases as they put the beat into the correct bin. Both decrease if beats are missed. In Learn Mode, players can use both their left and right hand to drag and drop the beats into the correct bin as they come out. Players can check their scores from the Game Mode and see if they made the high scores list. They can also record their own music to play the game to.

How to run the project: The player should run tp3try2.py in the editor. Make sure that gameAlg, startScreen,loseScreen, learnMode, winScreen, chooseSong, highScorePage, highScoreTry, helpScreen, findSongs, and getRecording python files are all in the same folder. For images, make sure that all images in the citation doc(imageCit.txt) are included in the same file as tp3try2.py. Lastly, in terms of music, the player only needs to have audsample2.wav in the same file and can either add more .wav files to the folder through downloading or use the recording option in the game to add more music to the game. Please note that when playing new modes or new songs, there will be a wait time as the file is being analyzed. The length of the wait time depends on the length of the file. The libraries that must be installed and imported will be written in the next section. Please make sure that for whatever editor you are using, the permissions for microphone, audio, and webcam or camera are all on or enabled. 
When recording audio, make sure that the song is loud enough to be registered clearly by your device's audio input.

Libraries: For this project, you will need to have pygame, pyaudio, numpy, wave, openCV, and json downloaded. Make sure that portaudio is installed as well on your device. From the Python libraries, sys, random, os, random, and string will be imported.

Shortcuts: Pressing "esc" on any page will bring you back to main start screen. Pressing "p" will pause the game. If the game does not register two gloves, it will automatically pause. Once you are ready, press "p" to unpause the game. Do not press "esc" in the paused mode and vice versa. Please kill the terminal to stop playing the game and to turn off the camera.
